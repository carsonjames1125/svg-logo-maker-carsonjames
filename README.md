# SVG LOGO GENERATOR

## Description

The motivation for this project was to combine javascript using node.js and installing modules from inquirer to generate a logo using input from the user to pick the 1-3 character name for the logo, the color of the name, the logo color, and the shape of the logo. This solves a problem that if you want a logo to be created and you dont want to pay someone to do so, itll help you create one. I learned how to attach and link multiple js files to create a logo. 


## Installation

To install this project, you first would have to install inquirer@8.2.4 and then isolate what you want to use within that program as well as any other programs. To activate the program you enter node index.js into the command line.
